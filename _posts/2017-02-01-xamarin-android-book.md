# Xamarin.Android Book

There's been one thing that Xamarin developers have repeatedly told me in the past:

> You should write a book with all of the knowledge you have.

I've finally taken this into consideration and decided that I will be writing a complete
book on `Xamarin.Android`.

I hope to help you with the challenges of `Android` app development using the `Xamarin.Android` framework whether
you are new to app development or already nose deep into a project.

This book will be much different than most `Xamarin` books in the sense that it will focus purely on the `Xamarin.Android`
platform.

I've added a field for your feedback as to what you want to see covered in more depth.
