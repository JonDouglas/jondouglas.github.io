I've decided to rewrite my blog completely in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The reasons being is that my old blog was on Wordpress and took too long to create posts and get new content properly formatted. I'm a huge fan of Markdown, so it seems like a perfect fit. I've also moved it to a free host via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Because of the conversion, I'll only be converting the popular articles on my blog and not any of my personal stuff.
